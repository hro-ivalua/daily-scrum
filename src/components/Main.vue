                <p>" Fascinated by the computer world since I was a child, I chose development. This practice combines
                    logic, pragmatism and creativity which are values I particularly like. Driven by my attention to
                    detail, my perseverance and my curiosity have allowed me to evolve continuously. The field of
                    computer development fascinates me and interests me, integrating myself into it was logical and
                    natural, being moreover, in full correlation with my state of mind. "</p>
